# ESP32_Bluetooth_Keyboard_MessageSend_keypress
This project uses ESP32_WROOM-32 to identify as a bluetooth keyboard. It will send a predetermined message when a key is pressed
This project builds up on the example in the bluetooth keyboard example. 
The ESP 32 connects to a laptop via bluetooth. Open a notepad and place the cursor. When the button is pressed, the predetermined message is typed on the notepad or MSWORD 
This is inspired from https://github.com/T-vK/ESP32-BLE-Keyboar
